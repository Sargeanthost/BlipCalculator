# Blip Calculator

## What is the point of this tool?
I grew tired of relying on other people finding blip entrances for me and wasting both my time and their time sifting 
through footage. Not only that, but I realized that taking days to do a complex blip just to find out that it wasn't 
possible, or the realization that I had to do it again once I got the entrance from the first jump was just plain stupid.
So, I created this tool.

*Future features:*

This tool exports the offset Y coordinate after completing an arbitrary amount of jumps. You can use the chain feature
if you want to find the n<sup>th</sup> blip where the blip remains consistent e.g., chained lily blips, or you can use
the `Blip Height` and `Jump Apex` labels to plug in more complicated blips.
